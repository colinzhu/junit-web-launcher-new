# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The JUnit Web Launcher is a web-based application that enables users to discover, select, and execute JUnit test cases from their classpath through a browser interface. The system provides real-time test execution monitoring, generates Allure reports, and maintains a historical archive of test runs and reports for analysis and re-execution.

## Glossary

- **Test_Discovery_Engine**: The component responsible for scanning the classpath and identifying JUnit test cases
- **Web_Interface**: The browser-based user interface for test selection and execution
- **Test_Executor**: The component that runs selected JUnit test cases
- **Report_Generator**: The component that creates Allure reports from test execution results
- **Report_Archive**: The storage system for historical test reports and logs
- **Test_Case**: A single JUnit test method
- **Test_Class**: A Java class containing one or more JUnit test methods
- **Allure_Report**: A comprehensive HTML test report generated by the Allure framework

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Test Discovery and Filtering

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to automatically discover JUnit test cases in my classpath with optional package filtering, so that I can quickly identify which tests are available to run.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Web_Interface loads, THE Test_Discovery_Engine SHALL scan the classpath and identify all JUnit test cases
2. WHERE a package name filter is specified, THE Test_Discovery_Engine SHALL restrict discovery to test cases within that package and its sub-packages
3. WHEN discovery completes, THE Web_Interface SHALL display all discovered test cases organized by Test_Class
4. THE Web_Interface SHALL display the fully qualified class name for each Test_Class
5. THE Web_Interface SHALL display the count of Test_Cases within each Test_Class

### Requirement 2: Test Selection Interface

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to select specific test cases or entire test classes for execution, so that I can run only the tests I need.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Web_Interface SHALL provide checkboxes for selecting entire Test_Classes
2. THE Web_Interface SHALL allow users to expand Test_Classes to view individual Test_Cases
3. WHEN a Test_Class is expanded, THE Web_Interface SHALL display all Test_Cases as selectable items with checkboxes
4. WHEN a Test_Class checkbox is selected, THE Web_Interface SHALL automatically select all Test_Cases within that class
5. WHEN a Test_Class checkbox is deselected, THE Web_Interface SHALL automatically deselect all Test_Cases within that class
6. THE Web_Interface SHALL display a Run button that becomes enabled when at least one test is selected

### Requirement 3: Test Execution and Real-Time Monitoring

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see real-time log messages while tests are running, so that I can monitor test progress and identify issues immediately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Run button is clicked, THE Test_Executor SHALL execute all selected Test_Cases
2. WHILE tests are executing, THE Web_Interface SHALL stream log messages to the browser in real-time
3. WHILE tests are executing, THE Web_Interface SHALL display the current execution status
4. WHEN a Test_Case completes, THE Web_Interface SHALL display its result status (passed, failed, skipped)
5. THE Web_Interface SHALL maintain the chronological order of log messages

### Requirement 4: Test Execution Cancellation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to cancel a running test execution, so that I can stop long-running or problematic tests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHILE tests are executing, THE Web_Interface SHALL display a Cancel button
2. WHEN the Cancel button is clicked, THE Test_Executor SHALL terminate the current test execution
3. WHEN execution is cancelled, THE Web_Interface SHALL display a cancellation notification
4. WHEN execution is cancelled, THE Test_Executor SHALL preserve any logs generated before cancellation

### Requirement 5: Allure Report Generation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to automatically generate Allure reports after test execution, so that I can analyze test results in detail.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN test execution completes, THE Report_Generator SHALL create an Allure_Report from the test results
2. THE Report_Generator SHALL name each report using a timestamp format (YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS)
3. WHEN report generation completes, THE Web_Interface SHALL provide a link to view the Allure_Report
4. WHEN report generation completes, THE Web_Interface SHALL provide a button to download the Allure_Report as an archive
5. THE Report_Archive SHALL store each generated Allure_Report for future access

### Requirement 6: Historical Report Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to view and download historical test reports, so that I can compare test results over time and track quality trends.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Web_Interface SHALL display a list of all historical Allure_Reports
2. WHEN displaying historical reports, THE Web_Interface SHALL show the report timestamp and execution summary
3. THE Web_Interface SHALL allow users to view any historical Allure_Report in the browser
4. THE Web_Interface SHALL allow users to download any historical Allure_Report as an archive
5. THE Web_Interface SHALL sort historical reports by timestamp in descending order (newest first)

### Requirement 7: Historical Log File Access

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to view and download historical log files, so that I can investigate past test executions and debug issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Report_Archive SHALL store log files for each test execution with timestamp-based naming
2. THE Web_Interface SHALL display a list of all historical log files
3. THE Web_Interface SHALL allow users to view any historical log file in the browser
4. THE Web_Interface SHALL allow users to download any historical log file
5. THE Web_Interface SHALL sort historical log files by timestamp in descending order (newest first)

### Requirement 8: Report Combination (Optional)

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to combine multiple test run reports into a single consolidated report, so that I can see aggregated test results across multiple executions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHERE Allure supports report merging, THE Web_Interface SHALL provide a report combination feature
2. WHERE report combination is available, THE Web_Interface SHALL allow users to select multiple historical Allure_Reports
3. WHEN multiple reports are selected for combination, THE Report_Generator SHALL merge them into a single consolidated Allure_Report
4. WHEN report combination completes, THE Web_Interface SHALL provide access to view and download the combined report
5. THE Report_Archive SHALL store combined reports with a naming convention that indicates they are merged reports

### Requirement 9: Failed Test Re-execution and Combination (Optional)

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to re-run only failed test cases and combine the results with the original report, so that I can verify fixes without re-running all tests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHERE a test execution contains failed Test_Cases, THE Web_Interface SHALL provide a "Re-run Failed Tests" option
2. WHEN the re-run option is selected, THE Test_Executor SHALL execute only the Test_Cases that failed in the selected run
3. WHEN re-execution completes, THE Report_Generator SHALL create a new Allure_Report for the re-run
4. WHERE report combination is available, THE Web_Interface SHALL offer to combine the re-run report with the original report
5. WHEN reports are combined after re-run, THE combined report SHALL show the updated status for re-executed Test_Cases
